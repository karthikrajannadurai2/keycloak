In Keycloak, **Executors** in Client Policies define specific actions or enforcement mechanisms that are applied when certain conditions in a policy are met. Executors are the core components of client policies that actually "execute" the rules and constraints, ensuring that clients comply with the security, compliance, or configuration standards set by the administrators. Executors work in conjunction with conditions to enforce policies on client settings, such as authentication methods, protocols, or attribute configurations.

### Key Concepts of Executors

1. **Purpose of Executors**: Executors are responsible for implementing the specific checks or modifications on client configurations. When a condition within a policy is met, the executors associated with that policy carry out the necessary actions (e.g., validating or modifying client settings).

2. **Types of Executors**: Keycloak provides several built-in executors for common actions, like enforcing HTTPS for redirect URIs, mandating specific authentication methods, or ensuring compliance with OpenID Connect standards.

3. **Custom Executors**: Administrators can create custom executors using Keycloak’s Service Provider Interface (SPI) to meet unique requirements not covered by default executors. Custom executors can enforce tailored rules and are useful for complex, organization-specific use cases.

### Common Built-In Executors in Keycloak

Here are some common executors available in Keycloak’s client policies:

1. **Enforce HTTPS Redirect URIs Executor**
    - **Description**: Ensures that all client redirect URIs use HTTPS, enforcing secure data transmission.
    - **Use Case**: If an application requires secure communication, this executor guarantees that only HTTPS redirect URIs are allowed, rejecting any client configuration that uses HTTP.

2. **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) Enforcement Executor**
    - **Description**: Requires clients to use PKCE, which adds a layer of security to the authorization code flow, particularly for public clients (e.g., mobile and single-page applications).
    - **Use Case**: This executor is essential for applications that need to secure the authorization code flow against interception attacks. It ensures clients use PKCE, enhancing OAuth security.

3. **Allowed Client Authenticator Executor**
    - **Description**: Specifies which client authenticators (like client secrets or JWTs) are permitted.
    - **Use Case**: Useful for enforcing strong authentication methods. For example, administrators can restrict clients to using private key JWTs rather than simple client secrets, increasing security.

4. **Enforce Secure Request Object Executor**
    - **Description**: Ensures that requests sent to Keycloak are signed and optionally encrypted, especially useful for OpenID Connect requests.
    - **Use Case**: For clients that handle sensitive data or operate in high-security environments, this executor requires signed request objects to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

5. **Allowed Client Scopes Executor**
    - **Description**: Restricts clients to specific scopes or permissions, limiting the resources or data clients can access.
    - **Use Case**: This executor is valuable for applying the principle of least privilege, ensuring that clients only access the minimum necessary data.

6. **Enforce JWT (JSON Web Token) Audience Executor**
    - **Description**: Verifies that JWTs issued to clients contain specific audience claims, ensuring tokens are used only by designated services or clients.
    - **Use Case**: Enforces that tokens are issued with specific audience claims to prevent misuse by unauthorized parties, which is especially useful in microservices architectures.

### Example: Using Executors in Client Policies

Imagine you want to enforce security standards for all client applications in a Keycloak realm, such as mandating HTTPS for all redirect URIs and requiring PKCE for public clients. Here’s how you might set up the client policy with executors:

1. **Create a Client Policy** named "Secure Client Configurations."
2. **Define Conditions**:
    - Apply the policy to all clients or to clients with specific attributes (e.g., public clients).
3. **Add Executors**:
    - **Enforce HTTPS Redirect URIs**: Ensures all redirect URIs use HTTPS.
    - **PKCE Enforcement**: Requires all public clients to use PKCE, adding an additional layer of security to the authorization code flow.

When a client registers or updates its configuration, Keycloak checks if these conditions are met and, if so, applies the executors to enforce HTTPS and PKCE.

### Custom Executors

For organizations with specialized requirements, Keycloak allows creating custom executors through its **Service Provider Interface (SPI)**. Custom executors can implement unique validation logic or enforce business-specific rules not covered by the default executors.

#### Example of a Custom Executor

Suppose your organization has a specific requirement where client names must follow a particular format or prefix. You could create a custom executor to:

1. **Check the Client Name Format**: Validate that each client name starts with a required prefix (e.g., `internal-`).
2. **Enforce Compliance**: Reject any client registration or update that doesn’t meet the required name format.

By adding this custom executor to a policy, Keycloak will automatically enforce the naming convention whenever a client is created or modified.

### Setting Up Executors in Keycloak

1. **Log in** to the Keycloak Admin Console.
2. **Go to Realm Settings** and select **Client Policies**.
3. **Create a New Policy** or **Edit an Existing Policy**.
4. **Add Conditions**: Set any conditions needed to trigger the policy.
5. **Select Executors**: Choose and configure executors to define the enforcement actions.
6. **Save** the Policy.

After setup, whenever a client matches the policy’s conditions, the configured executors will apply the rules and enforce the defined actions.

### Summary

Executors in Keycloak's client policies are essential tools for enforcing security, compliance, and configuration standards on client applications. With built-in executors, administrators can easily enforce common security practices, and custom executors allow for tailored rules that meet specific organizational requirements. By defining appropriate executors in client policies, Keycloak administrators can automate client management, ensure consistency, and enhance the security posture of their identity and access management (IAM) solutions.
