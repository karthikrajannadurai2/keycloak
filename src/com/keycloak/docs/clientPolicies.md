In Keycloak, **Client Policies** are a set of rules and configurations that govern how client applications (referred to as "clients" in Keycloak) interact with the Keycloak server within a specific realm. These policies enhance security, enforce compliance, and ensure that client applications adhere to organizational standards and best practices. By defining client policies, administrators can control aspects such as client registration, authentication methods, protocol usage, and more.

### Overview of Client Policies

Client Policies in Keycloak allow you to:

- **Enforce Security Standards**: Ensure that all clients meet specific security requirements, such as using secure protocols or strong authentication methods.
- **Automate Client Management**: Streamline the client registration and configuration process by applying predefined rules.
- **Enhance Compliance**: Adhere to regulatory standards by enforcing policies that govern client behavior and data access.
- **Simplify Administration**: Reduce the administrative overhead by automating the enforcement of policies across multiple clients.

### Key Components of Client Policies

1. **Policy Types**
2. **Policy Definitions**
3. **Policy Conditions**
4. **Policy Actions**
5. **Policy Ordering and Priority**

### 1. Policy Types

Keycloak supports various types of client policies that address different aspects of client management:

- **Client Registration Policies**: Control how clients are registered, including automatic registration, manual approval, and attribute validation.
- **Client Authentication Policies**: Define the authentication methods clients must use to interact with Keycloak (e.g., client secrets, JWT assertions).
- **Protocol Policies**: Specify which OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocols and flows clients can use.
- **Attribute Policies**: Enforce specific attributes or configurations on client applications, such as redirect URIs, scopes, and token settings.
- **Authorization Policies**: Manage access to resources and define permissions for clients interacting with protected resources.

---

### 2. Policy Definitions

A **Policy Definition** outlines the specific rules and configurations that must be applied to clients. Each policy definition typically includes:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the policy.
- **Description**: A brief explanation of what the policy enforces.
- **Type**: The category of the policy (e.g., registration, authentication).
- **Conditions**: Criteria that determine when the policy should be applied.
- **Actions**: The enforcement mechanisms or changes applied when the policy conditions are met.

#### Example Policy Definition

**Name**: Enforce HTTPS Redirect URIs

**Description**: Ensures that all client redirect URIs use HTTPS to secure data transmission.

**Type**: Attribute Policy

**Conditions**:
- Applies to all clients within the realm.

**Actions**:
- Validate that each redirect URI starts with `https://`.
- Reject client registrations with non-HTTPS redirect URIs.

---

### 3. Policy Conditions

**Conditions** determine when a policy should be applied to a client. They can be based on various client attributes or external factors. Common conditions include:

- **Client ID Patterns**: Apply policies to clients matching specific naming conventions.
- **Client Roles**: Enforce policies based on client roles or groups.
- **Client Protocol**: Target clients using particular protocols (e.g., OpenID Connect, SAML).
- **Attribute Values**: Apply policies based on specific attribute values (e.g., redirect URIs, scopes).

#### Example Condition

**Condition**: Client ID starts with `internal-`

This condition targets all clients whose IDs begin with the prefix `internal-`, allowing specific policies to be applied exclusively to internal applications.

---

### 4. Policy Actions

**Actions** define what happens when a policy's conditions are met. These actions can include:

- **Validation**: Check client attributes against defined rules and reject non-compliant configurations.
- **Modification**: Automatically adjust client settings to comply with policies.
- **Notification**: Send alerts or logs when policy conditions are triggered.
- **Approval Workflows**: Require administrative approval for client registrations or changes.

#### Example Action

**Action**: Modify Redirect URIs

If a client registers with a non-HTTPS redirect URI, the policy action could automatically prepend `https://` to enforce secure redirect endpoints.

---

### 5. Policy Ordering and Priority

When multiple policies apply to a single client, the order and priority in which policies are evaluated and enforced become crucial. Keycloak allows administrators to:

- **Set Policy Priority**: Assign priority levels to policies to determine the order of execution. Higher priority policies are evaluated before lower priority ones.
- **Define Policy Dependencies**: Specify dependencies where certain policies must be applied before others.
- **Manage Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts when multiple policies affect the same client attribute differently.

### Configuring Client Policies in Keycloak

To configure client policies within a realm in Keycloak, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Access Client Policies

1. **Log in** to the Keycloak Admin Console.
2. **Select** the desired **Realm** from the dropdown menu.
3. **Navigate** to **Client Policies** under the **Realm Settings** section.

#### Step 2: Create a New Policy

1. **Click** on **Create Policy**.
2. **Provide** the necessary details:
    - **Name**: Enter a unique name for the policy.
    - **Description**: Describe the purpose of the policy.
    - **Type**: Select the appropriate policy type (e.g., registration, authentication).
3. **Define Conditions**:
    - **Add Condition**: Specify the criteria that determine when the policy applies.
4. **Define Actions**:
    - **Add Action**: Choose the enforcement mechanisms or modifications.
5. **Save** the policy.

#### Step 3: Assign Policies to Clients

1. **Navigate** to **Clients** within the realm.
2. **Select** a client to which you want to apply policies.
3. **Configure** client-specific settings that align with the defined policies.
    - This may include setting redirect URIs, assigning roles, or adjusting protocol settings based on the policies.
4. **Apply** and **Save** the configurations.

### Example: Enforcing Secure Redirect URIs

Let's walk through an example of creating a client policy that ensures all client redirect URIs use HTTPS.

#### Step 1: Create the Policy

1. **Name**: Enforce HTTPS Redirect URIs
2. **Description**: Ensure all client redirect URIs are secured with HTTPS.
3. **Type**: Attribute Policy

#### Step 2: Define Conditions

- **Condition**: Apply to all clients in the realm.

#### Step 3: Define Actions

- **Action**: Validate that each redirect URI starts with `https://`. Reject any client registration or update that includes non-HTTPS redirect URIs.

#### Step 4: Assign and Test

1. **Assign** the policy to the realm.
2. **Attempt** to register a new client with a non-HTTPS redirect URI.
3. **Observe** that Keycloak rejects the registration, enforcing the policy.

### Best Practices for Client Policies

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Clearly outline what each policy is intended to achieve, whether it's enhancing security, ensuring compliance, or streamlining client management.
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name policies in a way that reflects their purpose, making it easier to manage and understand their roles.
3. **Prioritize Policies Appropriately**: Assign priorities to ensure critical policies are enforced before less critical ones.
4. **Test Policies Thoroughly**: Before rolling out policies to all clients, test them with a subset of clients to ensure they work as intended without unintended side effects.
5. **Regularly Review and Update**: As organizational needs and security standards evolve, regularly review and update client policies to maintain their effectiveness.
6. **Leverage Composite Roles**: Use composite roles within policies to manage groups of permissions efficiently.
7. **Document Policies**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for each policy, including its purpose, conditions, and actions, to facilitate maintenance and onboarding of new administrators.

### Advanced Features

**1. Custom Policy Providers**

Keycloak allows the creation of **custom policy providers** using its Service Provider Interface (SPI). This enables administrators to implement bespoke logic that goes beyond built-in policy capabilities.

- **Use Cases**:
    - Integrate with external systems for dynamic policy decisions.
    - Implement complex validation rules based on external data sources.

**2. Policy Chains**

Policies can be organized into **policy chains**, where multiple policies are applied in a specific sequence. This ensures that policies are enforced in a controlled and predictable manner.

- **Example**:
    - First, enforce HTTPS redirect URIs.
    - Next, validate client roles.
    - Finally, apply protocol-specific restrictions.

**3. Audit and Logging**

Enable auditing for client policies to track policy enforcement and modifications. This is essential for compliance and troubleshooting.

- **Features**:
    - Log policy evaluations and actions.
    - Monitor policy violations and take corrective actions.
