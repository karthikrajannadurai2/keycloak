The `META-INF/services` directory is crucial in JAR files for enabling the **Java Service Provider Interface (SPI)** pattern, which allows dynamic discovery and loading of classes (service providers) at runtime without hard-coding dependencies. This setup is especially useful for creating extensible frameworks and applications.

### How `META-INF/services` Works in JARs

1. **Directory Structure**:
   Inside the JAR file, the `META-INF/services` directory contains files that each represent a service interface. The filename is the fully qualified name of the interface (for example, `com.example.SomeService`), and the content lists the implementations of that interface.

2. **Service Provider Configuration File**:
   - Each file in `META-INF/services` corresponds to an interface (the service) and lists one or more implementation classes (the providers), each on a new line.
   - When the JAR is loaded, Java can use this file to find and instantiate the classes listed as implementations of the interface.

   For example, suppose you have an interface `com.example.SomeService` and an implementation `com.example.impl.SomeServiceImpl`. The structure inside the JAR would be:

   ```
   META-INF/
       services/
           com.example.SomeService
   ```

   Inside `com.example.SomeService`, you would list:

   ```plaintext
   com.example.impl.SomeServiceImpl
   ```

### Why `META-INF/services` in JARs Is Useful

- **Decoupling Implementation**: The application can discover and load different implementations without changing code, promoting modularity.
- **Extensibility**: Frameworks like Keycloak, Spring, and Java’s core libraries use this to allow third-party developers to add new functionality through plugins or custom implementations.
- **Dynamic Loading**: The Java `ServiceLoader` class can load classes based on `META-INF/services` files at runtime, making it easy to switch or add new implementations.

### Loading Providers with `ServiceLoader`

Java’s `ServiceLoader` class uses `META-INF/services` files to load implementations at runtime. Here’s an example:

```java
import java.util.ServiceLoader;

ServiceLoader<SomeService> loader = ServiceLoader.load(SomeService.class);
for (SomeService service : loader) {
    service.performService(); // Use the service
}
```

### Example in Keycloak

For Keycloak, the SPI mechanism heavily relies on `META-INF/services`. If you create a custom provider (e.g., a custom authentication flow), Keycloak will discover it through the service file when the JAR is placed in Keycloak’s `providers` directory.

For example, if you create a provider that implements `org.keycloak.provider.ProviderFactory`, you would create:

1. **File**: `META-INF/services/org.keycloak.provider.ProviderFactory`
2. **Content**:
   ```plaintext
   com.example.keycloak.CustomProviderFactory
   ```

When you start Keycloak, it scans `META-INF/services` files and loads all providers registered as implementations of `ProviderFactory`.

### Key Considerations

- **Multiple JARs**: If multiple JARs in the classpath define the same service interface, Java combines all providers listed across those files.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Order isn’t guaranteed if multiple providers are defined for the same service. You may need logic to choose a specific provider.

Using `META-INF/services` enables modular and extensible applications, allowing you to build plug-and-play components that are dynamically discovered and loaded.
