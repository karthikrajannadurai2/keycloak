In Keycloak, the **Sessions** settings within **Realm Settings** allow administrators to manage and configure how user sessions are handled, including Single Sign-On (SSO) sessions, access tokens, and login sessions. Proper session management is crucial for both user experience and security, as it determines how long users remain logged in, when they are prompted to re-authenticate, and how access tokens are issued and refreshed.

Here’s a breakdown of the **Sessions** section in **Realm Settings**:

---

### 1. **SSO Session Idle**
This setting defines the maximum time a **Single Sign-On (SSO)** session can remain **idle** before being considered inactive.

- **SSO Session Idle Timeout (Seconds)**:
    - This controls the amount of time an SSO session can be idle (i.e., without any user interaction) before it expires.
    - Once this timeout is reached, the user will be required to log in again.
    - Example: Setting this to `1800` seconds (30 minutes) means that if the user is inactive for 30 minutes, they will need to log in again.

  **Use case**: If users frequently step away from their computers, setting this to a low value (e.g., 10-15 minutes) can help reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to inactive sessions.

### 2. **SSO Session Max**
This setting controls the **maximum lifespan** of an SSO session, regardless of user activity.

- **SSO Session Max Lifespan (Seconds)**:
    - This defines the maximum time an SSO session can exist, even if the user remains active. Once this time is reached, the session expires, and the user is required to log in again.
    - Example: If you set this to `36000` seconds (10 hours), the user will be logged out after 10 hours, even if they’ve been actively using the application during that time.

  **Use case**: This ensures that users must periodically log in, even during long work sessions, which improves security.

### 3. **SSO Session Idle (Remember Me)**
This setting is similar to the **SSO Session Idle Timeout**, but it applies when the **Remember Me** feature is enabled (i.e., when users check the "Remember Me" option at login).

- **SSO Session Idle Timeout Remember Me (Seconds)**:
    - This defines how long a session can be idle before expiring when **Remember Me** is active. Users who select “Remember Me” are typically granted longer sessions.
    - Example: If set to `604800` seconds (7 days), the session will remain active for 7 days of inactivity when the “Remember Me” option is used.

  **Use case**: Extending session time for trusted devices allows for a more seamless user experience without frequent logins, though it should be used with caution for security reasons.

### 4. **SSO Session Max (Remember Me)**
This setting controls the maximum lifespan of an SSO session when the **Remember Me** feature is enabled.

- **SSO Session Max Lifespan Remember Me (Seconds)**:
    - This defines the maximum time a session can last with **Remember Me** enabled, regardless of user activity.
    - Example: Setting this to `1209600` seconds (14 days) will allow the session to persist for 14 days, even if the user remains active.

  **Use case**: Users who frequently log in from a trusted device can remain logged in for longer periods without being prompted to re-authenticate.

### 5. **Client Session Idle**
This setting controls how long a **client session** (the session created between Keycloak and the client application) can remain idle before it expires.

- **Client Session Idle Timeout (Seconds)**:
    - This defines how long a client session can remain idle before it expires. Once expired, the user must re-authenticate.
    - Example: If set to `1800` seconds (30 minutes), the client session will expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.

  **Use case**: This ensures that even if the user is active elsewhere, the session between Keycloak and the client application does not persist indefinitely.

### 6. **Client Session Max**
This setting determines the maximum lifespan of a client session, even if the user remains active.

- **Client Session Max Lifespan (Seconds)**:
    - This controls the maximum length of time a client session can last, after which it expires regardless of activity.
    - Example: Setting this to `36000` seconds (10 hours) ensures that the client session will expire after 10 hours of use.

  **Use case**: This ensures that even active users periodically re-authenticate for security reasons.

### 7. **Offline Session Idle**
**Offline sessions** are special sessions created when a user logs in and selects the "Offline Access" option. This allows clients to interact with Keycloak even when the user is not actively logged in.

- **Offline Session Idle Timeout (Seconds)**:
    - This controls how long an offline session can remain idle before it expires. Once expired, the session is no longer valid.
    - Example: Setting this to `2592000` seconds (30 days) means that the offline session will expire after 30 days of inactivity.

  **Use case**: Offline access is useful for long-lived applications where the user may not log in frequently but still needs to maintain access.

### 8. **Offline Session Max**
This setting controls the maximum lifespan of an offline session, regardless of activity.

- **Offline Session Max Lifespan (Seconds)**:
    - This defines the maximum time an offline session can last, after which it will expire even if the session is still technically in use.
    - Example: If set to `2592000` seconds (30 days), the offline session will expire after 30 days, even if it's used during that time.

  **Use case**: This limits how long offline access can persist, even for actively used applications, ensuring users periodically re-authenticate.

### 9. **Login Timeout**
This setting controls the maximum amount of time a user has to complete the login process.

- **Login Timeout (Seconds)**:
    - This defines how long a login session remains valid while the user is authenticating.
    - Example: If set to `300` seconds (5 minutes), the user must complete the login process within 5 minutes, or the session will expire, and they’ll need to start over.

  **Use case**: Limiting login time helps mitigate the risk of stale authentication attempts and reduces the window for potential abuse.

### 10. **Login Action Timeout**
This setting controls how long actions like password resets, email verifications, or other user actions initiated during login remain valid.

- **Login Action Timeout (Seconds)**:
    - This defines how long a login action (such as a password reset or account linking) is valid. After this time, the user will need to start the process again.
    - Example: If set to `1800` seconds (30 minutes), users have 30 minutes to complete the password reset process.

  **Use case**: It prevents long-lived, vulnerable actions from staying valid for too long, reducing the risk of token misuse.

### Use Cases and Best Practices

- **Security**: Short session timeouts and expirations improve security by limiting how long an attacker can use a stolen session. If your system requires a high level of security (e.g., for financial systems), keep timeouts short and enforce frequent re-authentication.

- **User Experience**: For consumer-facing applications or less sensitive use cases, longer session lifespans (especially with the **Remember Me** feature) can improve the user experience by minimizing login prompts.

- **Offline Access**: When building applications that need to function with long-lived tokens (e.g., mobile apps), **offline sessions** and their timeouts play a crucial role. They ensure the application continues to function without requiring constant re-authentication while still applying an expiration mechanism for security.

### Conclusion

The **Sessions** settings in Keycloak’s realm configuration give you granular control over session lifespans, idle timeouts, and session expiration for different types of sessions, such as SSO sessions, client sessions, and offline sessions. These settings allow you to balance between security (by enforcing frequent re-authentication) and user experience (by keeping sessions active longer). Adjusting these configurations based on your security requirements and user behavior is essential for maintaining both secure and user-friendly applications.
