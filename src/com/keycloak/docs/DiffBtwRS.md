The primary difference between **RS256**, **RS384**, and **RS512** lies in the **hashing algorithm and key size used during the signing process**. Each algorithm name represents the **RSA signature algorithm** with a different **SHA-2 hashing function**:

1. **RS256**: Uses SHA-256 for hashing.
2. **RS384**: Uses SHA-384 for hashing.
3. **RS512**: Uses SHA-512 for hashing.

Here’s a breakdown of the differences among these algorithms:

### 1. **Hashing Algorithm (Security Level)**

- **RS256**: Uses **SHA-256** for hashing, which creates a 256-bit hash. It provides a good balance of security and performance and is widely used in applications, including OAuth and OpenID Connect.
- **RS384**: Uses **SHA-384**, which produces a 384-bit hash. This algorithm is more secure than RS256 due to the longer hash size but is also slightly slower.
- **RS512**: Uses **SHA-512**, creating a 512-bit hash. This algorithm offers the highest level of security among the three due to the longer hash length but is the slowest of the three.

### 2. **Performance**

The performance decreases slightly as you increase the hash length:
- **RS256** is the fastest, making it suitable for applications that prioritize performance and still require strong security.
- **RS384** is moderately slower than RS256 but offers better security.
- **RS512** is the slowest due to the larger hash size, and it's best used when the highest security level is required, and performance is not a critical factor.

### 3. **Compatibility**

- **RS256** is widely supported and is the default algorithm in many systems using JWTs. It’s compatible with most libraries and systems that handle JWTs, making it a safe and commonly chosen option.
- **RS384** and **RS512** are also widely supported but may have less compatibility in some libraries or systems than RS256 due to the increased complexity and larger output.

### 4. **Use Cases**

- **RS256**: Commonly used in most applications, including OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and other JWT-based authentication systems, due to its balance between security and performance.
- **RS384**: Suitable for environments where slightly stronger security than RS256 is preferred, such as in financial or government systems.
- **RS512**: Ideal for highly sensitive data in environments requiring the highest level of security (e.g., healthcare, highly classified data), where performance is less critical.

### Summary Table

| Algorithm | Hash Function | Hash Size | Security Level | Performance |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **RS256** | SHA-256       | 256 bits  | High           | Fast        |
| **RS384** | SHA-384       | 384 bits  | Higher         | Moderate    |
| **RS512** | SHA-512       | 512 bits  | Highest        | Slower      |

**In summary**: All three are RSA algorithms that differ only in the hashing strength and resulting performance, with RS256 being the most common due to its efficient balance of security and speed.
