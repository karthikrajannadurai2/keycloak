**ACR to LoA Mapping** in Keycloak is related to handling authentication requirements and ensuring that the security context (level of authentication) meets specific standards.

### What is ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference)?

The **Authentication Context Class Reference (ACR)** is a value that defines the method or strength of user authentication in the context of OpenID Connect (OIDC). ACR is a claim that indicates how the user was authenticated. It is often used in scenarios where you want to ensure the user is authenticated with a specific method (e.g., password, multi-factor authentication, etc.).

### What is LoA (Level of Assurance)?

**Level of Assurance (LoA)** refers to a classification that defines how confidently a system can verify the identity of a user based on the authentication process. Levels of Assurance are usually defined by regulatory frameworks or standards (such as NIST 800-63 or eIDAS) and are often used in government or highly regulated environments.

For example, LoA can range from 1 to 4, where:
- **LoA 1**: Low confidence (e.g., password-based authentication).
- **LoA 2**: Moderate confidence (e.g., password plus email verification).
- **LoA 3**: High confidence (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
- **LoA 4**: Very high confidence (e.g., smart card or biometrics).

### ACR to LoA Mapping in Keycloak

In Keycloak, **ACR to LoA Mapping** allows you to map OpenID Connect (OIDC) **ACR values** to **LoA levels**. This ensures that different authentication contexts (e.g., password, OTP, biometrics) can be translated to corresponding assurance levels based on organizational or regulatory requirements.

#### Why Map ACR to LoA?

- **Compliance**: If your application requires a certain LoA for security or regulatory reasons (e.g., financial services or government applications), mapping ACR to LoA ensures that the required level of assurance is met.
- **Flexibility**: Applications can use ACR values in authentication requests, and Keycloak will map those to the correct LoA to enforce policies around user authentication.

### How to Configure ACR to LoA Mapping in Keycloak

1. **Log into Keycloak Admin Console**:
    - Access the Keycloak Admin Console at `http://<host>:8080/auth/admin/`.

2. **Navigate to Authentication**:
    - In the left sidebar, click on **Authentication**.

3. **Set Up ACR to LoA Mapping**:
    - Go to **ACR to LoA Mapping** under the authentication configuration.
    - Here, you can define which ACR values correspond to specific LoA levels.

4. **Add Mappings**:
    - For each ACR value (e.g., `password`, `mfa`, `sms`), you can specify the corresponding LoA level (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    - Example:
        - `acr_value: urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze` → `LoA 1`
        - `acr_value: urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver` → `LoA 2`
        - `acr_value: urn:mace:incommon:iap:gold` → `LoA 3`

5. **Save the Configuration**:
    - Once you have mapped the ACR values to the corresponding LoA levels, save the configuration.

6. **ACR Request by Client**:
    - A client application can request a specific ACR value in an authentication request. Keycloak will ensure that the authentication method used for the user matches the required LoA level by applying the mapping.

### Example Use Case: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Let’s say your application requires a high level of security (LoA 3) for accessing sensitive information, and your Keycloak instance has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.

- **ACR for Password Authentication**: If the user logs in with just a password, the ACR might be `password`, which maps to **LoA 1**.
- **ACR for MFA**: If the user logs in with multi-factor authentication, the ACR might be `mfa`, which maps to **LoA 3**.

When the client application requests a login with **LoA 3**, Keycloak will ensure that the user goes through multi-factor authentication (MFA) to meet the required assurance level.

### Key Benefits of ACR to LoA Mapping:
- **Granular Control**: It allows you to define and enforce specific authentication methods for different assurance levels.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensures that users authenticate at the required security level based on the sensitivity of the data or regulatory needs.
- **User Experience**: Minimizes friction by allowing users to authenticate with simpler methods (e.g., passwords) when lower assurance levels are acceptable while enforcing stronger methods (e.g., MFA) for higher levels.

### Example Configuration for ACR to LoA Mapping:

| ACR Value                      | LoA Level |
|---------------------------------|-----------|
| `urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze`  | LoA 1     |
| `urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver`  | LoA 2     |
| `urn:mace:incommon:iap:gold`    | LoA 3     |
| `password`                      | LoA 1     |
| `mfa`                           | LoA 3     |

By configuring ACR to LoA mapping in Keycloak, you can align your authentication requirements with specific assurance levels to enhance security and meet compliance requirements.
