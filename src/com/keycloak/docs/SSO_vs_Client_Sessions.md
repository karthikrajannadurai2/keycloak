In Keycloak, both **SSO (Single Sign-On)** sessions and **Client sessions** are part of the session management system, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of the authentication process. Here’s a comparison to help understand their roles, differences, and how they work together.

---

### **SSO Sessions**

#### 1. **Purpose**:
- An **SSO session** is created when a user authenticates with Keycloak for the first time within a realm. It represents the user’s authenticated session across all applications (clients) within that realm.
- The primary purpose is to enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across multiple client applications, meaning that once the user logs in to one client, they don’t need to log in again for other clients within the same realm, as long as the SSO session is active.

#### 2. **Scope**:
- **Realm-wide**: The SSO session is **global** within the Keycloak realm. This means that once a user logs in, they can access any client application that trusts the Keycloak realm, without re-authenticating (as long as the session is active).

#### 3. **Timeouts**:
- **Idle Timeout**: This defines how long the user can be idle across all clients before the SSO session expires. If the user is inactive for too long, they must log in again.
- **Max Lifespan**: Even if the user is continuously active, the SSO session will eventually expire after a certain time, forcing the user to re-authenticate.

#### 4. **Examples**:
- Suppose a user logs into an internal company portal that authenticates through Keycloak. They then access an internal email system or file storage application without needing to log in again because the **SSO session** is still valid.

#### 5. **Use Case**:
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SSO sessions enable users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to re-authenticate, making it more convenient in multi-client environments.

### **Client Sessions**

#### 1. **Purpose**:
- A **Client session** is specific to a single client application within the Keycloak realm. It represents the interaction between Keycloak and the individual client (e.g., a web application or mobile app) for that particular user session.
- The client session tracks the relationship between the user, Keycloak, and the specific application the user is accessing, managing authentication tokens (e.g., access tokens and refresh tokens) used by the application.

#### 2. **Scope**:
- **Client-specific**: Client sessions are specific to the **client application**. A user can have multiple client sessions active simultaneously for different applications, even if they are within the same realm.

#### 3. **Timeouts**:
- **Client Session Idle Timeout**: This defines how long the session between the user and the specific client application can remain idle before it expires.
- **Client Session Max Lifespan**: This controls the maximum time a client session can be active, after which it will expire regardless of user activity. When this happens, the client must request a new session.

#### 4. **Examples**:
- If the user logs into an application (e.g., a CRM system) that relies on Keycloak for authentication, a **client session** is established between the CRM and Keycloak. This session manages the user's access token, refresh token, and permissions for that specific application.

#### 5. **Use Case**:
- **Application-specific Authentication**: Client sessions are used by individual client applications to manage how they interact with Keycloak for authentication and token management.

### **Key Differences**

| **Feature**               | **SSO Session**                             | **Client Session**                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**                 | Realm-wide (applies to all clients)         | Client-specific (applies to one application)     |
| **Purpose**               | Enables Single Sign-On (SSO)                | Manages authentication between Keycloak and the client |
| **Idle Timeout**          | Controls global user inactivity across clients | Controls user inactivity for a specific client    |
| **Max Lifespan**          | Defines how long the user can remain logged in to the realm | Defines the session duration for the specific client |
| **Example**               | Logging into one app allows access to other apps | Manages token lifecycle for a single application |
| **Impact**                | Affects access to all clients in the realm  | Affects only the specific client application     |
| **Token Management**      | Not directly concerned with token lifecycle | Manages access and refresh tokens for the client |

### **How SSO and Client Sessions Work Together**

- **When a user logs in**, Keycloak creates an **SSO session** for the user, which is valid for all client applications in that realm.
- For each client the user accesses, Keycloak creates a **client session** to manage the authentication tokens (e.g., access tokens and refresh tokens) for that specific application.
- **SSO session** ensures the user doesn’t have to re-authenticate when accessing multiple applications.
- **Client session** ensures each application has the necessary tokens and handles the session lifecycle between the user, Keycloak, and that application.

For example, if the user logs in to a web-based CRM system, Keycloak creates an **SSO session** for the user. If the user then accesses an email system or a file-sharing application that also uses Keycloak, they don’t need to log in again because the **SSO session** is still valid. For each of these applications, a separate **client session** is created to manage their individual tokens.

---

### Summary

- **SSO sessions** are realm-wide and allow users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without needing to log in again.
- **Client sessions** are specific to each application and manage the relationship between Keycloak, the client, and the user’s tokens for that application.

<b><span style="color:red">The SSO and Client sessions are closely related, the final outcome is the lowest duration one</span><b>

<b><span style="color:green">For example:- if SSO Session Idle is 30 min, Client Session Idle is 20 min, the final one in token is 20 minute. because the SSo is global and client is specific to the client.Same for other timeouts also.</span>
