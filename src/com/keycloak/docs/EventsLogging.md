Keycloak provides an event system that tracks and logs various activities within the realm. These **events** are useful for monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting purposes. Events can be categorized into **Admin Events** and **User Events**. Keycloak can store these events in a database, and it also offers options to send them to external systems such as logging frameworks or monitoring systems.

### Types of Events in Keycloak

1. **User Events (Login Events):**
    - These are events related to user actions, such as login, logout, registration, and token refresh.
    - User events help track activities related to authentication and authorization, like when a user logs in, fails to authenticate, or updates their profile.

2. **Admin Events:**
    - Admin events log actions performed by administrators in the Keycloak admin console, such as creating realms, adding users, or changing client configurations.
    - These events are useful for auditing administrative actions and ensuring accountability.

### How to Enable and View Events in Keycloak

#### 1. **Enable Event Logging**

By default, Keycloak does not log events. You must explicitly enable them.

##### **Enabling User Events:**

- **Log in to Keycloak Admin Console**.
- Navigate to the **Realm Settings** in the left sidebar.
- Go to the **Events** tab.
- Under **Event Listeners**, enable the types of listeners where you want the events to be logged (e.g., **jboss-logging**, **email**, **syslog**, or custom listeners).
- Check the **Save Events** checkbox to persist events to the database.
- You can also configure event retention by enabling **Expiration**, which automatically deletes events after a specified time period.

##### **Enabling Admin Events:**

- In the **Realm Settings** → **Events** tab, scroll to the **Admin Events** section.
- Enable **Admin Events** and **Include Representation** if you want to log details of the changes (such as which fields were changed).

#### 2. **Configure Which Events to Track**

- In the **Events** tab, you can select specific **User Events** and **Admin Events** to track.
- Some common **User Events**:
    - `LOGIN`
    - `LOGIN_ERROR`
    - `LOGOUT`
    - `REGISTER`
    - `CODE_TO_TOKEN`
    - `RESET_PASSWORD`
    - `TOKEN_REFRESH`
- Some common **Admin Events**:
    - `CREATE`
    - `UPDATE`
    - `DELETE`
    - `IMPERSONATE`
    - `REALM_EXPORT`

You can choose to track only specific events to reduce noise and focus on relevant actions.

#### 3. **View Logged Events**

To view logged events:

- Go to **Events** in the left sidebar.
- Select the **Event Logs** tab to view **User Events**. You can filter events by type, user, or date.
- To view **Admin Events**, go to the **Admin Events** tab and filter the logs similarly.

The logged data will include information like:
- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred.
- **Type**: The event type (e.g., `LOGIN`, `LOGOUT`, `UPDATE_PROFILE`).
- **User**: The user affected by the event.
- **IP Address**: The IP address from which the event originated.
- **Details**: Additional information relevant to the event, such as the user ID, client ID, or error messages.

### Event Listeners and Extensions

Keycloak allows for custom event listeners if you need to integrate with other systems or perform custom actions based on events.

1. **Built-in Event Listeners**:
    - **JBoss Logging**: Logs events to the console or a file.
    - **Syslog**: Sends logs to a syslog server.
    - **Email**: Sends an email notification for certain events (like failed login attempts).

2. **Custom Event Listeners**:
    - You can develop your own custom event listeners by implementing Keycloak’s event listener SPI (Service Provider Interface).
    - Use this to integrate with systems like monitoring dashboards (e.g., Prometheus) or message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
    - To register a custom event listener, deploy the custom code as a Keycloak provider, and it will appear as an option under **Event Listeners** in the admin console.

### Practical Uses of Keycloak Events

1. **Security Monitoring**:
    - Track failed login attempts and receive notifications for suspicious activity (like repeated failed logins from a single IP).
    - Log access events to detect unauthorized access or anomalies in user behavior.

2. **Auditing**:
    - Use admin events to maintain an audit trail of administrative actions in Keycloak.
    - Ensure accountability by tracking who created, updated, or deleted resources like users, clients, or roles.

3. **Compliance**:
    - Many industries require detailed logging of authentication and access events for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    - Events can help maintain logs for compliance audits and investigations.

4. **Troubleshooting**:
    - Event logs can be used to debug issues with authentication flows or identify misconfigurations in the realm or clients.
    - Admin events help trace changes that might have caused system issues or access problems.

### Example of a User Event

A successful login event might look like this in the logs:

```json
{
  "type": "LOGIN",
  "realmId": "my-realm",
  "clientId": "my-client",
  "userId": "1234-5678-9012",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "details": {
    "username": "johndoe",
    "auth_method": "openid-connect",
    "redirect_uri": "http://my-app/callback"
  },
  "timestamp": 1694463892391
}
```

### Example of an Admin Event

An admin event that logs a role update:

```json
{
  "type": "UPDATE",
  "realmId": "my-realm",
  "resourceType": "USER",
  "resourcePath": "users/1234-5678-9012/role-mappings",
  "operationType": "UPDATE",
  "authDetails": {
    "userId": "admin-id",
    "clientId": "admin-cli",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.101"
  },
  "representation": {
    "roles": ["admin", "user"]
  },
  "timestamp": 1694463893000
}
```

In summary, Keycloak's event system is a powerful tool for monitoring and auditing user and admin actions within a realm. Whether you're tracking login events for security purposes, or logging admin changes for auditing, Keycloak events provide detailed insights into the operations within your identity and access management system.
