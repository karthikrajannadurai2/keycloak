The **User Profile** feature in Keycloak allows administrators to configure and customize the attributes, fields, and settings related to a user's profile within a realm. This feature gives control over which information is collected from users, how it is displayed, and validation rules, making it more adaptable for various use cases and requirements.

### Key Elements of User Profile Configuration

The **User Profile** section in a realm's settings in Keycloak includes the following primary elements:

1. **Attributes**
2. **Attribute Groups**
3. **User Attribute Validation**
4. **Internationalization**

### 1. **Attributes**

Attributes are custom fields added to a user’s profile in Keycloak. These are beyond the default fields like username, email, and password, and they can represent additional data such as phone numbers, addresses, or other user-specific information.

#### Configuration Options for Attributes:
- **Name**: The attribute’s internal name (e.g., `phone_number`).
- **Display Name**: The label displayed in the user interface (e.g., "Phone Number").
- **Type**: Specifies the type of data this attribute holds (e.g., `String`, `Boolean`, `Integer`, `List`, etc.).
- **Required**: Determines whether the attribute must be provided by the user.
- **Read-Only**: If checked, the attribute cannot be modified by the user.
- **Scoped to Roles**: Attributes can be scoped to specific roles, allowing certain attributes to be visible only to users with particular roles.
- **Permissions**: You can control if the attribute is editable by users themselves, by administrators only, or by other specific roles.

#### Example Use Cases for Attributes:
- **Employee ID**: Add an employee ID field that only administrators can edit.
- **Department**: Create a department attribute visible only to users with an HR role.
- **Preferred Language**: Add a preferred language field that users can update themselves.

### 2. **Attribute Groups**

Attributes can be grouped together into logical sections to make the user profile more organized and easier to navigate. For example, an "Address Information" group can contain address-related attributes like `street`, `city`, `state`, and `postal code`.

#### Benefits of Attribute Groups:
- **Logical Organization**: Grouping makes it easier for users to locate specific information.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Allows related attributes to appear together in the user interface, simplifying the process for users.
- **Conditional Visibility**: Groups can be set to be visible based on specific conditions or roles, ensuring that users or admins see only the relevant information.

### 3. **User Attribute Validation**

Each attribute in Keycloak’s User Profile can have validation rules applied to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Validation is useful for ensuring fields like emails, phone numbers, or dates follow the correct formats.

#### Common Validation Options:
- **Regex Patterns**: Use regular expressions to enforce a specific pattern for text fields (e.g., email format).
- **Length Constraints**: Set minimum and maximum character limits for text attributes.
- **Allowed Values**: For list-type fields, restrict input to predefined options (e.g., `Country` can only accept certain country names).
- **Custom Validators**: You can also create custom validation logic for specialized requirements (e.g., checking for a unique username format).

#### Example Use Cases for Validation:
- **Phone Number**: Ensure the phone number field follows a specific format like `+1-123-456-7890`.
- **Age**: Validate that the `age` attribute only accepts numeric values and is within a certain range (e.g., between 18 and 65).
- **Employee ID**: Ensure that the employee ID field only accepts alphanumeric characters and has a fixed length.

### 4. **Internationalization**

The User Profile feature supports **internationalization** for multi-language support. This allows attribute labels and other profile elements to be displayed in multiple languages, based on the user's or admin's preferred language setting.

#### Internationalization Features:
- **Localized Display Names**: The display names of attributes and groups can be translated into various languages.
- **Error Messages**: Validation error messages can also be translated, making error feedback more user-friendly for non-English speakers.

#### Example Use Cases for Internationalization:
- For global applications, you can display attributes like `First Name`, `Last Name`, and `Address` in users' preferred languages.
- Validation errors, such as "Phone number is invalid," can be translated based on the user's locale.

### Practical Example: Customizing User Profile for a Company

Imagine you are setting up a Keycloak instance for an organization with custom user profile requirements:

1. **Attributes**:
   - Add `employee_id` (String, required, read-only for users).
   - Add `department` (String, dropdown list with departments like Sales, HR, IT).
   - Add `phone_number` (String, required, validated by regex for phone number format).
   
2. **Attribute Groups**:
   - Create a group called "Personal Information" for `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `phone_number`.
   - Create another group called "Employment Details" for `employee_id` and `department`, visible only to users in the HR role.

3. **User Attribute Validation**:
   - Set regex validation for `phone_number` to ensure a standard format.
   - Ensure `employee_id` has a fixed length and is alphanumeric.

4. **Internationalization**:
   - Translate attribute labels to multiple languages so that users see fields like "Phone Number" and "Employee ID" in their preferred language.

### Enabling and Configuring the User Profile

1. **Enable User Profile**: Go to **Realm Settings** → **User Profile** and ensure it is enabled.
2. **Configure Attributes**: Add the necessary attributes and set their properties (e.g., `required`, `read-only`).
3. **Add Validation**: Apply validation rules as needed for data integrity.
4. **Organize Groups**: Arrange attributes into logical groups.
5. **Internationalization**: Add localized names and error messages as needed for each attribute.

The User Profile feature in Keycloak allows administrators to create a user experience tailored to organizational needs, improving the quality of user data and compliance with business rules.
