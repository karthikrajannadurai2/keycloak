In Keycloak, **Security Defenses** are an essential set of configurations available within the **Realm Settings** to help protect applications and users from various security threats. These settings help mitigate common security vulnerabilities and enforce secure practices in authentication and session management.

To configure security defenses, follow these settings found in the **Admin Console** under **Realm Settings** → **Security Defenses**. Here’s an explanation of each category and its importance:

---

### 1. **Headers**
The **Headers** section configures security-related HTTP headers that help prevent attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and other web vulnerabilities.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: This header helps prevent a wide range of attacks, including XSS. You can specify a **CSP** for your realm to control which resources are allowed to be loaded by the browser. For example, a simple policy could be:

  ```text
  default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self';
  ```

  This policy restricts the sources from which the browser can load scripts, styles, images, etc. If no CSP is defined, Keycloak will use a default policy.

- **Strict Transport Security**: Enabling **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** ensures that browsers only access Keycloak over HTTPS. This helps prevent downgrade attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. You can configure it like this:

  ```text
  max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
  ```

    - `max-age`: How long the browser should remember to enforce HTTPS (in seconds). E.g., `31536000` is one year.
    - `includeSubDomains`: Ensures HSTS applies to all subdomains of the realm.
    - `preload`: Allows the site to be included in the HSTS preload list maintained by browsers.

- **X-Frame-Options**: This header helps prevent **Clickjacking** by restricting how your Keycloak pages can be embedded into iframes. For example, setting it to `DENY` means your pages cannot be embedded in iframes at all.

  ```text
  DENY
  ```

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: This prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is specified in the `Content-Type` header. This is useful for preventing MIME-based attacks.

  ```text
  nosniff
  ```

- **X-XSS-Protection**: This is a legacy header to enable or disable XSS protection in older browsers. Newer browsers have built-in defenses, but for compatibility, you can set:

  ```text
  1; mode=block
  ```

### 2. **Brute Force Detection**
This section helps protect against **brute force attacks**, where an attacker tries to guess a user’s password by repeatedly attempting to log in.

- **Enabled**: Turn on **Brute Force Detection** to enable protections against brute force login attempts.

- **Max Login Failures**: Set the maximum number of failed login attempts allowed before the user’s account is temporarily locked.

- **Failure Reset Time (Seconds)**: Define the time after which the failed login attempts counter is reset. For example, setting this to `900` seconds (15 minutes) means that if no more attempts occur during this time, the failed attempts will be reset.

- **Lockout Duration (Seconds)**: If a user’s account is locked due to failed attempts, this setting defines how long their account will remain locked. You can set this to a specific duration, e.g., `300` seconds (5 minutes), or set it to `-1` for an indefinite lockout.

- **Wait Increment (Seconds)**: This adds a delay between each login attempt after the user exceeds the maximum number of failed logins, making brute force attacks slower and less effective.

- **Max Wait (Seconds)**: Defines the maximum delay that can be introduced between login attempts when the user keeps trying and failing to log in.

- **Permanent Lockout**: Enable this option if you want the account to be permanently locked after reaching the allowed number of failed attempts. Admin intervention would be required to unlock the account.

- **Quick Login Check MilliSeconds**: The minimum interval in milliseconds between two failed login attempts. This prevents fast, automated brute-force attacks.

- **Minimum Quick Login Wait (Seconds)**: The minimum delay time between failed login attempts during a brute force attack, to slow down repeated requests.

---

### 3. **Session Limits**
Session limits help control and secure user sessions by restricting concurrent sessions and session length.

- **Restrict Concurrent Logins**: This option ensures that a user can only have one active session at a time. Enabling this prevents session hijacking and shared accounts by limiting simultaneous logins.

- **Session Idle Timeout (Seconds)**: Defines how long a session can remain idle before it is considered inactive. Once the idle timeout is reached, the user is required to log in again.

- **Session Max Lifespan (Seconds)**: This setting controls how long a session can last, regardless of activity. Even if a user remains active, their session will expire after this time.

- **Remember Me Session Lifespan (Seconds)**: If you enable the “Remember Me” option in the login form, this setting controls how long the session can last when "Remember Me" is active.

---

### 4. **Token Settings**
Token settings help define the lifespan and refresh conditions for the different types of tokens that Keycloak issues (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens).

- **Access Token Lifespan**: Defines how long the access token is valid. Access tokens are short-lived by design, and once they expire, the client needs to use a refresh token to get a new access token.

- **Refresh Token Lifespan**: Defines how long a refresh token is valid. Once a refresh token expires, the user needs to authenticate again.

- **SSO Session Idle Timeout**: Defines how long a Single Sign-On (SSO) session can remain idle before it is considered inactive and the user must re-authenticate.

- **SSO Session Max Lifespan**: Defines the maximum lifespan for an SSO session, regardless of activity.

- **Client Session Idle Timeout**: The maximum idle time for a client session. After this period, the client session will expire, and the user will need to re-authenticate.

- **Client Session Max Lifespan**: The maximum lifespan of a client session. Once this time elapses, the user will need to re-authenticate, regardless of activity.

---

### 5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**
Keycloak includes built-in **CSRF** protection for browser-based applications. CSRF attacks trick authenticated users into making unwanted actions, such as changing their password or performing other actions on behalf of an attacker.

- **CSRF Protection**: This is enabled by default in Keycloak. Keycloak generates a CSRF token that is sent with each request, ensuring that only legitimate actions are performed on behalf of the user.

- **Cookie Security**: The session cookie used by Keycloak is flagged as **HttpOnly** and **Secure** by default, meaning it cannot be accessed via JavaScript and is only transmitted over HTTPS connections.

---

### 6. **Login Token Replay Protection**
This setting prevents **replay attacks**, where an attacker could intercept and reuse a login token to impersonate a user. Keycloak mitigates replay attacks by ensuring that tokens can only be used once.

- **Replay Detection**: Keycloak automatically detects and prevents replay attacks by invalidating tokens once they are used.

### Conclusion

The **Security Defenses** settings in Keycloak allow you to mitigate common security vulnerabilities and enforce secure practices, such as using strong HTTP headers, protecting against brute force attacks, controlling session limits, and ensuring token security. It's important to regularly review and update these settings to align with your security policies and application needs. Properly configured security defenses enhance the security posture of your Keycloak environment, protecting both the users and the applications it serves.
