**Identity brokering** and **identity providers** are related concepts in identity and access management, but they serve different roles. Here’s a breakdown of what each term means and how they differ:

### 1. Identity Providers (IdPs)
An **identity provider (IdP)** is a service that creates, maintains, and manages digital identities. IdPs authenticate users and provide applications with information about the authenticated users. They serve as the source of truth for identity and often use protocols such as **OAuth 2.0**, **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**, and **SAML** for secure authentication.

#### Examples of Identity Providers:
- **Google** (via Google Sign-In)
- **Microsoft Azure AD**
- **Okta**
- **Facebook**
- **GitHub**

When a user authenticates via an identity provider, the application (or relying party) trusts the IdP to validate the user's identity.

### 2. Identity Brokering
**Identity brokering** refers to a service or functionality that sits between an application and multiple identity providers, allowing users to log in via various IdPs without the application managing each one directly. Essentially, an identity broker facilitates authentication through multiple IdPs and enables **single sign-on (SSO)** across different systems and applications.

Keycloak, for example, acts as an identity broker by supporting integration with multiple identity providers. This allows applications to delegate user authentication to Keycloak, which then brokers the identity from an external IdP.

#### How Identity Brokering Works:
- The user attempts to access an application that relies on an identity broker (e.g., Keycloak).
- The broker provides a list of identity providers for the user to choose from (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- The broker redirects the user to the chosen IdP for authentication.
- Once the IdP authenticates the user, it returns a token or assertion to the broker.
- The broker validates this token and issues its own session/token for the application, acting as the intermediary.

#### Benefits of Identity Brokering:
- **Simplified authentication** for applications, as they don’t need to manage multiple IdP integrations.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across multiple applications by centralizing authentication with the broker.
- **Enhanced security and flexibility** by supporting various authentication protocols.

### Comparison: Identity Providers vs. Identity Brokering

| Aspect                     | Identity Providers (IdPs)                                   | Identity Brokering                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Authenticate users and manage identities.                   | Enable authentication through multiple IdPs.            |
| **Examples**               | Google, Microsoft Azure AD, Facebook, Okta                  | Keycloak (as broker), Auth0 (with multi-IdP support)    |
| **Protocols Supported**    | OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML                            | Typically supports multiple protocols like OAuth, SAML  |
| **User Management**        | Provides identity storage and user account management.      | Delegates to IdPs; does not typically store identities. |
| **SSO Support**            | SSO across applications within the IdP ecosystem.           | SSO across applications with various IdPs.              |
| **Application Integration**| Direct integration with the application.                    | Applications integrate only with the broker.            |

### Use Case Scenarios
- **Use an Identity Provider**: If you only need authentication from a single IdP, integrate directly with that IdP (e.g., Google Sign-In).
- **Use Identity Brokering**: If you want to offer users multiple login options via different IdPs, set up an identity broker like Keycloak to manage the authentication process across those IdPs. 

In summary, an **identity provider** authenticates users and provides identity data, while **identity brokering** connects multiple IdPs to enable flexible, centralized authentication for applications.
