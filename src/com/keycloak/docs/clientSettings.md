In Keycloak’s new UI, the **Client Details** page provides a range of settings that control how clients (applications) integrate with Keycloak for authentication and authorization. These settings define the protocols, redirect URIs, authentication methods, and other behaviors for client applications interacting with Keycloak.

Here’s a breakdown of the key sections and settings available in the **Client Details** page in the new Keycloak UI:

### 1. General Settings

**Client ID**
- A unique identifier for the client within the realm. This ID is used in authentication requests and should be unique for each client.

**Client Protocol**
- Specifies the protocol used for communication. Common protocols are **OpenID Connect** (OIDC) and **SAML**. This choice affects which options are available in other settings.

**Access Type**
- Defines how the client interacts with Keycloak.
    - **Confidential**: Clients have a secure interaction, often server-side, and require a client secret for authentication.
    - **Public**: Clients, such as single-page applications, do not require a client secret.
    - **Bearer-only**: Used for backend services that don’t initiate login flows, but only accept tokens.

**Standard Flow Enabled**
- Determines if the **Authorization Code** flow is enabled for OIDC clients. This is the standard flow for web applications, which provides a code that’s exchanged for tokens.

**Implicit Flow Enabled**
- Enables the **Implicit** flow, typically used in single-page applications. This flow provides tokens directly without the intermediate code exchange, but it is less secure.

**Direct Access Grants Enabled**
- Allows clients to request tokens directly using a username and password (Resource Owner Password Credentials flow). Use this only in trusted environments.

**Service Accounts Enabled**
- Activates service accounts for confidential clients, allowing them to authenticate and obtain tokens on behalf of themselves (client credentials grant). Used for machine-to-machine authentication.

**Authorization Enabled**
- Enables Keycloak’s authorization features, which allows more granular access control, including role-based and resource-based permissions.

### 2. Credentials

**Client Secret**
- Confidential clients use a client secret as a password for authenticating with Keycloak. You can regenerate this secret if needed.

**JWT Client Authentication**
- For confidential clients, you can use JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication instead of client secrets. This is often used for secure server-to-server interactions.

---

### 3. Authentication Flow Overrides

**Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)**
- This option enforces PKCE on authorization code flows, enhancing security, especially for public clients. PKCE protects against code interception attacks by requiring an additional code verification step.

---

### 4. Redirect URIs and Origins

**Valid Redirect URIs**
- Lists the URIs to which Keycloak is allowed to redirect after a successful login or logout. It’s essential to set these URIs to prevent open redirection attacks. Wildcards can be used but should be limited to secure, trusted subdomains.

**Web Origins**
- Specifies the allowed CORS origins for JavaScript applications. It controls which origins are allowed to interact with Keycloak’s endpoints via AJAX calls. Avoid using `*` here to enhance security.

---

### 5. Login Settings

**Consent Required**
- If enabled, users must approve access permissions each time they log in through this client. Useful when users need to consent to share data with the client application.

**Client Authentication Required**
- Requires the client to authenticate during requests, such as during token refreshes. For confidential clients, it typically requires a client secret.

---

### 6. Token Settings

**Access Token Lifespan**
- Defines how long the access token is valid before it expires. Shorter lifespans enhance security, especially for sensitive applications.

**Refresh Token Lifespan**
- Sets the lifespan of refresh tokens, which clients use to request new access tokens after the original access token expires.

**ID Token Signature Algorithm**
- Specifies the algorithm used to sign ID tokens, usually **RS256** by default, ensuring the tokens’ integrity and authenticity.

---

### 7. Fine-Grained Permissions (Authorization Services)

**Permissions Enabled**
- Turns on fine-grained authorization, allowing more complex access control using policies and permissions.

**Policy Enforcer**
- When enabled, Keycloak enforces authorization policies at the client level, allowing administrators to define policies directly on Keycloak.

---

### 8. Advanced Settings

**Backchannel Logout URL**
- Specifies a URL to notify the client when a backchannel logout request is triggered (e.g., when a user logs out of Keycloak). The client uses this URL to handle logout in a secure, server-side manner.

**Frontchannel Logout**
- If enabled, it performs frontchannel logouts via redirect, allowing applications to participate in logout using the browser.

**Access Token Signing Algorithm**
- Allows choosing the signing algorithm for access tokens. This setting can be adjusted for specific security requirements.

### Summary

The **Client Details** settings in Keycloak's new UI give you precise control over the client behavior, including authentication methods, redirect rules, token lifespans, and logout handling. Configuring these options based on the client type, security requirements, and use cases ensures that your applications integrate with Keycloak securely and efficiently.
