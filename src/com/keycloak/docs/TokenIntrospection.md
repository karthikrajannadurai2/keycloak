**Token introspection** in Keycloak is a mechanism that allows client applications or resource servers to verify the validity and details of a token issued by Keycloak. When a token is introspected, Keycloak returns detailed information about the token, including whether it's active (valid) and additional metadata such as the token’s expiration time, scope, associated user, and other attributes.

This process is particularly useful for validating access tokens or refresh tokens without needing to decode or verify them directly, especially when working with sensitive data or distributed microservices architectures.

### Key Concepts of Token Introspection

- **Access Tokens**: Tokens issued to clients to access protected resources. These tokens can be validated using introspection.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Tokens that allow a client to obtain new access tokens when the original expires. These can also be introspected to ensure they are still valid.
- **Resource Server**: The service or API that a client is trying to access using the token. The resource server typically introspects tokens to verify their validity before granting access to the requested resource.

### Why Use Token Introspection?

- **Real-time Validation**: Token introspection allows a client or resource server to check the status of a token at the current time. This is useful in case a token is revoked, invalidated, or expired.
- **Security**: It adds an additional layer of security for verifying tokens, especially for distributed systems where a token might be used across different services.
- **Metadata Retrieval**: Through introspection, clients can obtain additional details about the token such as scopes, expiry times, user information, etc., which can be used to enforce finer-grained access controls.

### Example of Token Introspection Flow

1. **Client Acquires Token**: A client application authenticates with Keycloak and obtains an access token (or refresh token).

2. **Client Sends Token to Resource Server**: The client sends this token to a resource server when making an API request or accessing a protected resource.

3. **Resource Server Introspects Token**: Before granting access, the resource server sends the token to Keycloak's **introspection endpoint** to verify if the token is valid.

4. **Keycloak Returns Token Status**:
    - **Active**: If the token is valid and active, Keycloak returns the token's details, including its expiration, scope, and associated user.
    - **Inactive**: If the token is expired, revoked, or otherwise invalid, Keycloak will return a response indicating the token is inactive.

5. **Access Granted or Denied**: Based on the introspection response, the resource server either grants or denies access to the client.

### How to Perform Token Introspection in Keycloak

To introspect a token in Keycloak, you need to send an HTTP POST request to the **token introspection endpoint** (`/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect`). The request must include the token and client credentials for authorization.

#### Endpoint URL:
```
POST /realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
```

#### Request Headers:
- **Content-Type**: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- **Authorization**: `Basic {client-id:client-secret}` (or other valid client credentials)

#### Request Body Parameters:
- **token**: The token you want to introspect (access token or refresh token).
- **token_type_hint** (optional): The type of the token (`access_token` or `refresh_token`).

#### Example Request:
```bash
curl --user client-id:client-secret \
     -d "token={token}" \
     -d "token_type_hint=access_token" \
     "https://{keycloak-server}/realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect"
```

#### Example Response (for a valid token):
```json
{
    "active": true,
    "username": "john_doe",
    "client_id": "my_client",
    "exp": 1693571000,
    "iat": 1693567400,
    "nbf": 1693567400,
    "scope": "profile email",
    "sub": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678",
    "aud": "my_client",
    "iss": "https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/myrealm"
}
```

#### Example Response (for an invalid token):
```json
{
    "active": false
}
```

### Response Fields:

- **active**: Indicates whether the token is still valid (`true` or `false`).
- **username**: The username associated with the token.
- **client_id**: The client that the token was issued to.
- **exp**: Expiration time (as a Unix timestamp) of the token.
- **iat**: Issued at time (as a Unix timestamp).
- **scope**: The scope associated with the token (e.g., `profile`, `email`).
- **sub**: The subject (user) associated with the token.
- **aud**: The audience of the token, typically the client ID of the application.
- **iss**: The issuer of the token, which is the Keycloak server.

### Use Cases for Token Introspection

1. **API Gateway Validation**:
    - When you have an API Gateway or resource server that handles multiple microservices, you can use token introspection to validate tokens for requests hitting each microservice.

2. **Revocation Checks**:
    - If tokens can be revoked (e.g., when a user logs out or a session is terminated), introspection allows real-time verification to ensure the token hasn’t been revoked.

3. **Additional Token Information**:
    - Introspection provides metadata about the token (such as the scope and associated user), which can be used to enforce authorization policies based on the details of the token.

4. **Long-Lived Access**:
    - For applications that use long-lived tokens (such as offline or refresh tokens), token introspection allows you to check the token's status before allowing access to sensitive resources.

### Token Introspection vs JWT (Self-Contained Tokens)

Keycloak access tokens are often **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)**, which are **self-contained** tokens. This means you can validate them without contacting Keycloak by using public key cryptography (because JWTs contain their own signature and payload).

However, introspection offers advantages over JWT validation:

- **Real-time status**: JWTs are valid until their expiration but don’t handle revocation or immediate session changes. Introspection allows real-time checking for token validity and ensures tokens haven’t been revoked.
- **Simplified validation**: Some systems may not have the capability to decode and validate JWTs locally. Introspection provides a straightforward API for token validation.
- **Access to additional metadata**: While JWTs contain user and token metadata, introspection can provide more information or update token information that might not be available in the original JWT.

### Conclusion

Token introspection in Keycloak provides a powerful mechanism to validate tokens and retrieve metadata in real-time, especially useful in systems with distributed services and sensitive data. By leveraging this feature, you can add an extra layer of security to ensure that tokens are valid, active, and haven’t been revoked, while also retrieving additional information for enforcing granular access controls.
