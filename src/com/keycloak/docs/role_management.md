In Keycloak, the **"Assign Roles"** tab is used to assign specific roles to users, groups, or clients. Roles in Keycloak are permissions that grant access to certain functionalities within a realm. Roles can be either **realm roles** (global roles that apply to the entire realm) or **client roles** (roles specific to a particular client or application).

### Key Concepts of the "Assign Roles" Tab:

1. **Realm Roles vs. Client Roles:**
    - **Realm Roles**: These roles are global to the entire realm and can be applied to users across multiple clients. For example, a "realm-admin" role might give a user access to the Keycloak admin console.
    - **Client Roles**: These roles are specific to a particular client. A user assigned a client role will have access to the features or actions defined for that role within that specific client. For example, a "read-only" role for an application.

2. **Assigning Roles to Users:**
    - When you assign roles to a user, it grants them the permissions associated with those roles.
    - Roles can be assigned to users manually or programmatically (e.g., through the API).
    - Users can have multiple roles, and these roles may come from both the realm and specific clients.

### Steps to Assign Roles to a User:

#### 1. **Access Keycloak Admin Console**
- Log in to the Keycloak admin console and navigate to your realm.

#### 2. **Select a User**
- In the sidebar, click on **Users**.
- Select the user you want to assign roles to by clicking on their username.

#### 3. **Navigate to the "Role Mappings" Tab**
- Once you're in the user's profile, go to the **Role Mappings** tab. This is where you can manage role assignments for the user.

#### 4. **Assign Realm Roles**
- Under the **Realm Roles** section:
    - The **Available Roles** box on the left lists all the realm roles that you can assign to the user.
    - The **Assigned Roles** box on the right lists the roles currently assigned to the user.
- To assign a role, select it from the **Available Roles** list and click the **Add selected** button. The role will move to the **Assigned Roles** list.
- To remove a role, select it in the **Assigned Roles** list and click **Remove selected**.

#### 5. **Assign Client Roles**
- To assign client roles, select a client from the **Client Roles** dropdown.
    - The **Available Roles** box will now show roles specific to the selected client.
    - As with realm roles, you can add or remove client roles by selecting them and using the **Add selected** or **Remove selected** buttons.

### Use Cases for the "Assign Roles" Tab:
- **Access Control**: Use roles to define what actions a user can perform, either in the realm (like managing users or realms) or within a specific client (like reading or writing data).
- **Granular Permissions**: By combining multiple roles, you can create granular permission sets for each user, tailoring their access to specific parts of an application.
- **Group Roles**: Roles can also be assigned to user groups. This way, all users in the group inherit the assigned roles. The "Assign Roles" tab is useful for both users and groups, allowing bulk assignment of permissions.

### Examples of Role Assignment:
- **Realm Role Assignment**: Assigning the `admin` role gives a user admin rights across the entire realm, such as managing other users, configuring clients, or modifying the realm settings.
- **Client Role Assignment**: If you have a client application, such as an API, you can assign roles like `api-read` or `api-write` to specific users, which determines their access within that application.

### Tips for Managing Roles:
- **Composite Roles**: You can create composite roles, which are roles that bundle other roles together. Assigning a composite role assigns all the underlying roles at once.
- **Role Hierarchies**: Be mindful of role hierarchies and composites. If you assign a composite role, users will inherit all the roles within it.

By managing roles through the "Assign Roles" tab, Keycloak allows you to define precise access control and role-based permissions for users, which is key to securing applications and services.
